                        <p align="justify">Following the client meeting, the team has compiled a pitch video that
                            comprehensively covers
                            the meeting with the client and presents our key takeaways from the discussion.
                            The video effectively summarizes and addresses the user's requirements.
                        </p>

                        <ol> The video has been organized into the following categories for a clearer presentation:
                            <li><i><b>Background:</b></i> This section provides an explanation of the context and the problems
                                being addressed.</li>
                            <li><i><b>User Insights:</b></i> Here, we identify the user needs based on the insights gathered.
                            </li>
                            <li><i><b>Prototype Solution:</b></i> This part delves into the details of our proposed prototype
                                solution.</li>
                            <li><i><b>Conclusion:</b></i> A summary of our accomplishments during the first week and an
                                    outline of our next steps.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <p align="justify">The project coordinator, Jane Cowie, plays a crucial role in connecting various organizations 
                            and is actively involved in the community, sharing genuine thoughts and perspectives based on her experiences 
                            and feedback from the community. Through conversations with Jane, user insights revealed that the center 
                            faces challenges in staying operational due to the constant need for funding and tight project timelines. 
                            The center's focus is expanding to engage with different age groups, and it organizes events and classes to 
                            foster a supportive community. The importance of an archive system has been emphasized to showcase the center's history, 
                            collect stories from the community, and make these archives more accessible to the public. 
                        </p>
                        <p align="justify">    
                            The proposed solution is 
                            a user-friendly web interface that caters to different age groups and digital literacy levels, incorporating visual 
                            and audio aids to present history effectively. The key features include documenting the center's history with multimedia, 
                            showcasing diverse artworks with their backstories, and providing information on current and upcoming events and classes. 
                        </p>
                        <p align="justify">
                            In summary, the project aims to create an archive system through a user-friendly web interface that connects various 
                            organizations and community members. The center's history will be presented with multimedia elements, and diverse artworks 
                            will be showcased with their backstories. Additionally, the platform will provide information on current and upcoming events 
                            and classes. The iterative development process, guided by continuous user testing, will ensure that the web application 
                            effectively serves the community's needs and fosters a broader audience engagement.

                        <h2>Weekly Pitch Video 2</h2>
                        <p align="justify">After the second client meeting, our team has created a comprehensive pitch video that encompasses 
                            the design process and the progress we've made before meeting with the client. 
                            Additionally, it includes valuable insights we've gained from the client's feedback 
                            and their perspective on our product. This video serves as an effective summary of 
                            our team's overall progress on the product and highlights the remaining adjustments that need to be addressed before the showcase.
                        </p>

                        <ol> The video has been organized into the following categories for a clearer presentation:
                            <li><i><b>What we have learnt:</b></i> This section provides a quick rundown of what we, as a team, has learnt 
                                through prototyping and learnt from the users.</li>
                            <li><i><b>Prototyping:</b></i> In this part, we explain the methods we used to create prototypes for our design process. 
                                These methods were helpful in finding the key features of our application.
                            </li>
                            <li><i><b>Refinements from User Perspectives:</b></i> In this section, we discuss the improvements or adjustments our 
                                team has decided to implement based on feedback gathered from user perspectives.
                            </li>
                            <li><i><b>Conclusion:</b></i> A conclusion of our achievements and progress during the second week, along with an overview 
                                of the final steps we plan to take.
                            </li>
                        </ol>

                        <p align="justify">The team has learned valuable insights from prototyping, adopting both low fidelity and high fidelity methods. 
                            The low fidelity sketches allowed us to visualize the thought process and test website flow, identifying potential 
                            user needs without the need for initial coding. 
                            On the other hand, the high fidelity prototype simulated the actual product, enabling testing of user interactions and flow.
                        </p>
                        <p align="justify">    
                            Prototype refinements are deemed essential as they enhance the user experience by addressing usability issues and incorporating user feedback. 
                            Through an iterative process of refining prototypes before development, potential problems are identified and resolved early on, reducing risks.
                        </p>
                        <p align="justify">
                            After meeting with Jane and receiving feedback from her, she praised the prototype's effectiveness in addressing user requirements, she also gave valuable suggestions 
                            to enhance the website further. These suggestions included improving readability by increasing font size for art piece descriptions, 
                            enhancing visual appeal by using image carousels for events and classes posters, and enabling administrator access for easy addition of events and classes.
                        </p>
                        <p align="justify">
                            In conclusion, the team emphasizes the importance of leveraging various prototyping methods, user feedback, and continuous improvement. 
                            The next goal is to further develop and enhance the web prototype using actual archives, conduct user testing to ensure user-friendliness and 
                            purposeful functionality, and prepare for a showcase to demonstrate the website's capabilities.
