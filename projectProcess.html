                        <h2>19th July 2023</h2>
                        <p align="justify">The team, together with Team 5A, met with the client for the first time today. 
                            Leveraging the questions we prepared the previous day, we gained a deeper understanding of the client’s 
                            expectations and were able to align our development objectives. We were able to identify the key requirements
                            and goals that the client wants to achieve through the archival system:</p>

                            <ol>
                                <li>Create a straightforward design that highlights the events conducted and the rich history behind 
                                    various art pieces created by the community within The Annexe’s building</li>
                                <li>Allowing the system to act as bridge to connect with younger audiences</li>
                                <li>System should preferably be accessed through portable handheld devices, e.g. mobile
                                    phones or tablets</li>
                            </ol>

                        <p align="justify">The first requirement is catered to the current demographic at The Annexe, which mainly 
                            consists of elderly individuals aged 60 and above. Their lack of technological expertise requires 
                            our design to be extremely user-friendly to guide them through the application. The team came up with several
                            suggestions to improve usability, such as increasing the font size, incorporating more images to support
                            text descriptions, and introducing audio narrations to aid the elderly with poor eyesight.</p>

                        <p align="justify">Regarding the second requirement, the client mentioned that Annexe Communities provides help
                            to people aged 18 and above, however, the majority of the members are older people. She wishes that the system is able
                            to attract individuals of all age groups, especially from the younger demographic so that they can foster
                            a sense of unity and reinforce the community bond. The team thought of creating an Instagram account as it is 
                            one of the more popular social platforms used by the younger generation. However, we had our doubts on whether
                            this approach is feasible as it seem to be out of the project's scope. Additional work will have to be done 
                            by the Annexe staff to run the Instagram account frequently. Hence, we will be finding an alternative 
                            approach instead.</p>

                        <p align="justify">For the third requirement, the client's expectation was to have the members or visitors carry a 
                            handheld device during walks in the Annexe building and the device will provide information about the particular 
                            spot in the building. The team initially thought of creating a mobile app that can be used on phones 
                            and tablets. However, due to time constraints, creating a mobile application might not be a
                            feasible plan as it requires more time to develop as compared to a web application. Hence, the team 
                            decided to work on a mobile-friendly web application that is suitable for both laptops and mobile devices.</p>

                        <p align="justify">After receiving valuable information from our client, the team started working on the 
                            low-fidelity prototypes using paper sketches to map out the designs of our web application. Our immediate task
                            for tomorrow will be to focus on structuring the layout for the web application based on the low-fidelity prototype 
                            and identify any potential challenges so that we can address them promptly.</p>

                        <p align="justify">Today, the team made further progress in refining the low-fidelity prototype of the web 
                            application. After confirming the initial prototype yesterday, we shared a screenshot with the client, 
                            who responded positively to it. Subsequently, the team began the development phase using HTML and CSS.
                            The team finalized the main pages of the web application, which include the: </p>

                                <li>Homepage</li>

                                <li>Art</li>
                                <li>Events</li>
                                <li>Forum</li>
                                <li>Classes</li>

                            </ol>
                            
                        <p align="justify">Additionally, the color scheme was determined, with the main colors being purple, black, 
                            and white. The base layout of the homepage has been completed, with some minor improvements scheduled for 
                            later. Moreover, buttons to navigate the About Us, History, Art, Event, Forum, and Classes pages have been 
                            created.</p> 

                        <p align="justify">One significant challenge encountered today was arranging the contents on the homepage. Given 
                            that it incorporates images, texts, and animations, the team exerted extra effort to categorize and 
                            arrange them meticulously to achieve a visually appealing webpage. Fortunately, the team managed to 
                            resolve the majority of the issue, with some minor bugs that will be addressed on the following day.</p>

                        <p align="justify">During the lesson today, the team was given the opportunity to ideate and explore new ways to 
                            design prototypes. We learnt about other non-conventional prototyping methods as well as methods to improve
                            user experience. Through this process, it made us re-evaluate on the initial prototype that we designed. One 
                            major issue brought up by the team was the color scheme of the website.
                        </p>
                            
                        <p align="justify">The previous color scheme consists of colours such as dark purple and grey against a black 
                            background. The team felt that these darker colours made the website look dull and did not reflect the 
                            positive and vibrant vibes that The Annexe is conveying. To tackle this issue, we chose a new colour scheme 
                            for the website. The current colours consist of a white background with black and purple fonts to create 
                            contrast.
                        </p> 

                        <p align="justify">With this in mind, the team proceeded to design the prototypes for the other pages such as 
                            the About Us and Contact Us page. The team's next step is to finish up the prototypes for the remaining
                            pages such that we are able to update the client and receive early feedback on it.

                        <h2>24th July 2023</h2>
                        <p align="justify">After completing all the pages of the prototype over the weekend, the team gathered to discuss 
                            improvements as part of our continuous refinement process. The focal point of our discussion revolved around 
                            a crucial question: "How user-friendly is the website for The Annexe's target demographics?" The team established
                            once again that our goal is to create an aesthetically pleasing website that is able to cater to the common
                            issues faced by the majority age group at The Annexe which are poor readability and limited computer literacy. 
                        </p>

                        <p align="justify">Based on the main question, we focused on improving the website's visibility, including font 
                            sizes, icons, and buttons. Firstly, we enhanced the font size of the navigation bar, making it larger than 
                            the original, and removed unnecessary icons to achieve a neater and more straightforward design. Secondly, 
                            we incorporated a headphone logo to represent audio playback, ensuring it is both prominently placed and of 
                            sufficient size for easy visibility. On the Contact Us page, we prioritized the three most important pieces 
                            of information: the address, phone number, and email address. Each of these details is now prominently 
                            displayed at the top of the page, with bolded text and a corresponding icon for added clarity.
                        </p>

                        <p align="justify">The team aims to finalise the 2nd version of the prototype by tomorrow, 25th July, as we are 
                            planning for a meetup with the client on 26th July to get feedback on the current prototype.

                        <h2>25th July 2023</h2>
                        <p align="justify">The team learned about opposing mental models and the Pro/Pro chart in today's lesson and 
                            we managed to use them to identify the areas in the website that can be improved on. One area we pinpointed 
                            was the text-to-speech icon, currently represented by a headphone. Some team members felt that a play 
                            button or an audio button might be a more intuitive design, while others argued in favor of keeping the 
                            headphone icon.
                        </p>

                        <p align="justify">Another conflicting model we had was the design of the calendar. The initial design was similar 
                            to the iPhone’s calendar, with a dot below the dates that had events. However, some of us felt that the dot 
                            was too small and might pose difficulties for the current demographics, which primarily consist of elderly 
                            people aged 60 and above. Considering their potential difficulty in seeing the small dot, we created a 
                            second design with the dates with events to be highlighted instead.
                        </p>

                        <p align="justify">We grouped the headphone logo with the highlighted dates as Model 1 and the play button with 
                            the dotted dates as Model 2. Through thorough discussion and consideration of each model's merits, we 
                            ultimately reached a consensus: to include both the headphone logo and the play button in the final design. 
                            The headphone logo possesses an intuitive nature and higher recognizability, while the play button serves as 
                            a better signifier to guide users, letting them know that there is playable audio. As for the calendar, we 
                            decided to go with the highlighting of the dates with events, ensuring enhanced visibility for all visitors to 
                            the website.
                        </p>

                        <p align="justify">The team will be finalising the second prototype by today and we will be consulting with the 
                            client tomorrow to gather her inputs on the design and discuss any modifications required.

                        <h2>26th July 2023</h2>
                        <p align="justify">We had our second client meeting today and showcased our prototype to our client. We received 
                            satisfactory feedback from her as well as some suggestions to improve on the prototype. The first suggestion 
                            was to increase the font size for the text descriptions. In the previous refinement, the team focused solely 
                            on increasing the font size of the navigation bar to allow users to browse the website easily; however, we 
                            missed out on the text descriptions of the main contents. 
                        </p>

                        <p align="justify">Next, the client wanted to include more images of their event posters as well as posters for 
                            their classes. She felt that some people preferred to view images before making a decision to visit and sign 
                            up for their classes. Hence, we will be changing the singular image of the event posters to image carousels 
                            instead so that more images can be included. The last suggestion given by the client was to add a function 
                            allowing website administrators to directly upload new events or classes. This would make it easier to record 
                            day-to-day activities.
                        </p>

                        <p align="justify">The team then discussed with the client about the headphone and play button for the 
                            text-to-speech feature, and she agreed that combining them was a better idea rather than having them displayed 
                            individually. We also proposed placing QR codes near the art pieces in The Annexe, enabling visitors to scan 
                            them and receive audio explanations. The client expressed her satisfaction with the proposal and gave us the 
                            green light to proceed. Before the meeting concluded, the client provided us with a thumb drive containing 
                            additional archives to be displayed on the website.
                        </p>
                            
                        <p align="justify">With the feedback and resources we have received today, the plan for tomorrow will be to filter 
                            through the resources given to us and upload them onto the website. We will also implement the suggestions 
                            mentioned such as increasing the font size, combining both headphone and play button for the text-to-speech 
                            function, and the replacement of the event posters to an image carousel.
