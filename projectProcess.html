                        <h5>Team Reflection</h5>
                        <br>    
                        <p align="justify">The team has gained many valuable lessons in this exhilarating 3-week journey to design a 
                            solution for our client, The Annexe. In the beginning, we faced uncertainty, with zero knowledge about the 
                            client, their expectations, and the module as a whole! However, as each day passed, we were taught new skills 
                            and strategies on how to achieve our goal. Lectures equipped us with essential knowledge for solution design, 
                            covering topics such as shared mental models, effective client communication, prototyping techniques, and 
                            usability testing. These information guided us through each phase of our development journey as shown in the 
                            project timeline above.
                        </p>
                        
                        <br>
                        
                        <p align="justify">During Phase 1: Requirement Gathering, we learnt the importance of not just understanding what 
                            the client wants, but also the alignment of each team member's understanding of the project and goals. We 
                            have to ensure that everyone in the team is on the same page in order to foster a cohesive and synchronised 
                            approach when communicating with the client. We also learned that clients often face uncertainty about their 
                            specific requirements or may be unclear about the full extent of our team's capabilities, making it challenging 
                            to pinpoint the exact goals they wish to achieve. This taught us the importance of adopting a flexible approach 
                            to structuring our questions during client interactions and probing for more details to gain a better 
                            understanding on their needs, enabling us to come up with more targeted prototypes in the next phase.
                        </p>
                            
                        <br>

                        <p align="justify">In the Prototyping phase, we experimented with paper prototypes and decided on developing a 
                            website as the solution for our client. Through this process, we learned how to put ourselves in the shoes of 
                            the intended users of the website. As The Annexe caters to an older demographic, we understood the importance 
                            of considering their unique constraints and needs. Our aim was to ensure that they could enjoy the product we 
                            created just as much as other user groups. One of the main constraints we identified was poor eyesight among 
                            some older users. To address this, we enhanced our solution's accessibility features such as increasing the 
                            font size and implementing text-to-speech so that the older users do not have to solely rely on reading to 
                            consume information, thus making our solution more inclusive and user-friendly.
                        </p>

                        <br>
                        
                        <p align="justify">The team also conducted continuous refinement of the solution through feedback from
                            the client or team members and which enabled us to identify new areas of improvement and pain points. We 
                            learned about crafting task situations for usability testing, which is important as it helps us assess how 
                            well users interact with our solution in real-world scenarios. While we may naturally understand what we 
                            developed, it is crucial to test it on a diverse group of people to ensure that it is universally 
                            understandable and usable.
                        </p>

                        <br>

                        <p align="justify">Throughout this journey, we were confronted with various challenges, including time 
                            constraints and uncertainty regarding the completeness of the solution. The short duration of this module
                            placed pressure on the team as deliverables had to be submitted within a tight timeframe. This taught us on
                            the importance of prioritising tasks, proper time management and setting realistic goals. We were also 
                            unsure of the level of completeness our solution should achieve to both satisfy the client's requirements 
                            and align with the module's scope. To overcome this challenge, the team proactively consulted the professor to 
                            clarify the deliverables expected from us and engaged in open communication with our client to manage their 
                            expectations and maintain transparency.
                        </p>
                            
                        <br>
                        
                        <p align="justify">Although we were unable to deliver a fully functioning website, we take immense pride in the 
                            work we achieved within the given constraints. The client's positive reaction during the review and exhibition 
                            served as a strong affirmation of the quality of our efforts. As we venture forward, we carry this invaluable 
                            experience and knowledge with us, inspired to create meaningful solutions that leave a positive impact on the 
                            world.

                            expectations and were able to align our development objectives. We were able to identify the key requirements
                            and goals that the client wants to achieve through the archival system:</p>

                            consists of elderly individuals aged 60 and above. Their lack of technological expertise requires 
                            our design to be extremely user-friendly to guide them through the application. The team came up with several
                            suggestions to improve usability, such as increasing the font size, incorporating more images to support
                            text descriptions, and introducing audio narrations to aid the elderly with poor eyesight.</p>

                        <p align="justify">Regarding the second requirement, the client mentioned that Annexe Communities provides help
                            to people aged 18 and above, however, the majority of the members are older people. She wishes that the system is able
                            to attract individuals of all age groups, especially from the younger demographic so that they can foster
                            a sense of unity and reinforce the community bond. The team thought of creating an Instagram account as it is 
                            one of the more popular social platforms used by the younger generation. However, we had our doubts on whether
                            this approach is feasible as it seem to be out of the project's scope. Additional work will have to be done 
                            by the Annexe staff to run the Instagram account frequently. Hence, we will be finding an alternative 
                            approach instead.</p>

                        <p align="justify">For the third requirement, the client's expectation was to have the members or visitors carry a 
                            handheld device during walks in the Annexe building and the device will provide information about the particular 
                            spot in the building. The team initially thought of creating a mobile app that can be used on phones 
                            and tablets. However, due to time constraints, creating a mobile application might not be a
                            feasible plan as it requires more time to develop as compared to a web application. Hence, the team 
                            decided to work on a mobile-friendly web application that is suitable for both laptops and mobile devices.</p>

                        <p align="justify">After receiving valuable information from our client, the team started working on the 
                            low-fidelity prototypes using paper sketches to map out the designs of our web application. Our immediate task
                            for tomorrow will be to focus on structuring the layout for the web application based on the low-fidelity prototype 
                            and identify any potential challenges so that we can address them promptly.</p>

                        <p align="justify">Today, the team made further progress in refining the low-fidelity prototype of the web 
                            application. After confirming the initial prototype yesterday, we shared a screenshot with the client, 
                            who responded positively to it. Subsequently, the team began the development phase using HTML and CSS.
                            The team finalized the main pages of the web application, which include the: </p>

                            <ol>
                                <li>Homepage</li>
                                <li>About Us</li>
                                <li>History</li>
                                <li>Art</li>

                                <li>Contact Us</li>
                            </ol>
                            
                        <p align="justify">Additionally, the color scheme was determined, with the main colors being purple, black, 
                            and white. The base layout of the homepage has been completed, with some minor improvements scheduled for 
                            later. Moreover, buttons to navigate the About Us, History, Art, Event, Forum, and Classes pages have been 
                            created.</p> 

                        <p align="justify">One significant challenge encountered today was arranging the contents on the homepage. Given 
                            that it incorporates images, texts, and animations, the team exerted extra effort to categorize and 
                            arrange them meticulously to achieve a visually appealing webpage. Fortunately, the team managed to 
                            resolve the majority of the issue, with some minor bugs that will be addressed on the following day.</p>

                        <h3>21st July 2023</h3>
                        <p align="justify">During the lesson today, the team was given the opportunity to ideate and explore new ways to 
                            design prototypes. We learnt about other non-conventional prototyping methods as well as methods to improve
                            user experience. Through this process, it made us re-evaluate on the initial prototype that we designed. One 
                            major issue brought up by the team was the color scheme of the website.
                        </p>
                            
                        <p align="justify">The previous color scheme consists of colours such as dark purple and grey against a black 
                            background. The team felt that these darker colours made the website look dull and did not reflect the 
                            positive and vibrant vibes that The Annexe is conveying. To tackle this issue, we chose a new colour scheme 
                            for the website. The current colours consist of a white background with black and purple fonts to create 
                            contrast.
                        </p> 

                        <p align="justify">With this in mind, the team proceeded to design the prototypes for the other pages such as 
                            the About Us and Contact Us page. The team's next step is to finish up the prototypes for the remaining
                            pages such that we are able to update the client and receive early feedback on it.

                        <p align="justify">After completing all the pages of the prototype over the weekend, the team gathered to discuss 
                            improvements as part of our continuous refinement process. The focal point of our discussion revolved around 
                            a crucial question: "How user-friendly is the website for The Annexe's target demographics?" The team established
                            once again that our goal is to create an aesthetically pleasing website that is able to cater to the common
                            issues faced by the majority age group at The Annexe which are poor readability and limited computer literacy. 
                        </p>

                        <p align="justify">Based on the main question, we focused on improving the website's visibility, including font 
                            sizes, icons, and buttons. Firstly, we enhanced the font size of the navigation bar, making it larger than 
                            the original, and removed unnecessary icons to achieve a neater and more straightforward design. Secondly, 
                            we incorporated a headphone logo to represent audio playback, ensuring it is both prominently placed and of 
                            sufficient size for easy visibility. On the Contact Us page, we prioritized the three most important pieces 
                            of information: the address, phone number, and email address. Each of these details is now prominently 
                            displayed at the top of the page, with bolded text and a corresponding icon for added clarity.
                        </p>

                        <p align="justify">The team aims to finalise the 2nd version of the prototype by tomorrow, 25th July, as we are 
                            planning for a meetup with the client on 26th July to get feedback on the current prototype.

                        <p align="justify">The team learned about opposing mental models and the Pro/Pro chart in today's lesson and 
                            we managed to use them to identify the areas in the website that can be improved on. One area we pinpointed 
                            was the text-to-speech icon, currently represented by a headphone. Some team members felt that a play 
                            button or an audio button might be a more intuitive design, while others argued in favor of keeping the 
                            headphone icon.
                        </p>

                        <p align="justify">Another conflicting model we had was the design of the calendar. The initial design was similar 
                            to the iPhone’s calendar, with a dot below the dates that had events. However, some of us felt that the dot 
                            was too small and might pose difficulties for the current demographics, which primarily consist of elderly 
                            people aged 60 and above. Considering their potential difficulty in seeing the small dot, we created a 
                            second design with the dates with events to be highlighted instead.
                        </p>

                        <p align="justify">We grouped the headphone logo with the highlighted dates as Model 1 and the play button with 
                            the dotted dates as Model 2. Through thorough discussion and consideration of each model's merits, we 
                            ultimately reached a consensus: to include both the headphone logo and the play button in the final design. 
                            The headphone logo possesses an intuitive nature and higher recognizability, while the play button serves as 
                            a better signifier to guide users, letting them know that there is playable audio. As for the calendar, we 
                            decided to go with the highlighting of the dates with events, ensuring enhanced visibility for all visitors to 
                            the website.
                        </p>

                        <p align="justify">The team will be finalising the second prototype by today and we will be consulting with the 
                            client tomorrow to gather her inputs on the design and discuss any modifications required.

                        <h3>26th July 2023</h3>
                        <p align="justify">We had our second client meeting today and showcased our prototype to our client. We received 
                            satisfactory feedback from her as well as some suggestions to improve on the prototype. The first suggestion 
                            was to increase the font size for the text descriptions. In the previous refinement, the team focused solely 
                            on increasing the font size of the navigation bar to allow users to browse the website easily; however, we 
                            missed out on the text descriptions of the main contents. 
                        </p>

                        <p align="justify">Next, the client wanted to include more images of their event posters as well as posters for 
                            their classes. She felt that some people preferred to view images before making a decision to visit and sign 
                            up for their classes. Hence, we will be changing the singular image of the event posters to image carousels 
                            instead so that more images can be included. The last suggestion given by the client was to add a function 
                            allowing website administrators to directly upload new events or classes. This would make it easier to record 
                            day-to-day activities.
                        </p>

                        <p align="justify">The team then discussed with the client about the headphone and play button for the 
                            text-to-speech feature, and she agreed that combining them was a better idea rather than having them displayed 
                            individually. We also proposed placing QR codes near the art pieces in The Annexe, enabling visitors to scan 
                            them and receive audio explanations. The client expressed her satisfaction with the proposal and gave us the 
                            green light to proceed. Before the meeting concluded, the client provided us with a thumb drive containing 
                            additional archives to be displayed on the website.
                        </p>
                            
                        <p align="justify">With the feedback and resources we have received today, the plan for tomorrow will be to filter 
                            through the resources given to us and upload them onto the website. We will also implement the suggestions 
                            mentioned such as increasing the font size, combining both headphone and play button for the text-to-speech 
                            function, and the replacement of the event posters to an image carousel.

                        <h3>27th July 2023</h3>
                        <p align="justify">Today, our team held a meeting to discuss the valuable feedback received from both our tutor, 
                            Yuxin, and our client, Jane. We diligently listed down the tasks for the day, arranging them in order from 
                            the least time-consuming to the most. Creating a to-do list was essential, focusing on the 
                            additions Jane requested for the website. The primary topic of discussion during the meeting revolved around 
                            the icon used for the text-to-speech function. Yuxin wisely pointed out that icons can be highly subjective, 
                            varying based on personal preferences. Considering this, we deliberated on the best approach, as having 
                            multiple icons might overwhelm users and lead to confusion.
                        </p>

                        <p align="justify">After a thorough discussion, we arrived at a finalized idea that strikes a balance. Our 
                            decision is to add the text “Play Audio” beside the headphone icon. By doing so, users can either read the 
                            text label, which will have a significantly larger font size than the rest of the description, or they can 
                            refer to the icon to utilize the text-to-speech function seamlessly on the website. This way, we are able to 
                            improve the user experience on our website and create a more inclusive one that can accommodate more 
                            individuals.
                        </p>

                        <p align="justify">Our goal for today will be to complete the filtering of the images provided by our client 
                            yesterday. As there was a huge amount of media provided, we required an extra day to sieve through the more
                            significant ones that can be shown on the website to fully represent the best of The Annexe.

                        <p align="justify">In today's lesson, we learnt about user testing using paper prototypes to test how intuitive 
                            the website is to visitors who have not seen it before. To do so, we created sketches of the web pages we 
                            have done so far and put them to the test by asking friends to “play test” the website once we have crafted 
                            suitable questions. One of the things we learned today was to not give leading prompts. This was interesting 
                            as we did not think much about the questions we asked during user testing on previous projects and it got us 
                            thinking on how to improve the questions that will be asked during the user testing. With this, we tried to 
                            incorporate this idea for the questions we crafted for the user testing.
                        </p>
                        <p align="justify">After which, we placed our focus on completing the image carousel for the Events page which
                            was part of yesterday's to-do list. This allows for the posters of different events to be cycled through 
                            and showcased on the website. We have also included photos that we have received from the client, Jane, 
                            that were taken during the various events that they have had so far. This was one of the things Jane wanted 
                            to do as it allows for the visitors or even staff and members who participated in these events to look back
                            at the photos and have a sense of nostalgia reliving those moments.
                        </p>
                        <p align="justify">With this, we aim to tidy up and complete the website by 2nd August to give us time to look 
                            through and ensure that the work is of quality. We will also be performing our user testing on 31st July so 
                            that we have enough time to make any changes before the deadline.

                        <p align="justify">This afternoon, the team had a consultation session with Yuxin to gather feedback regarding our 
                            website. One of her suggestions was to add visual cues, such as changing the cursor to a pointer when hovering 
                            over clickable images or links, so that users know they are interactive elements. Another important suggestion 
                            was to incorporate a back button on the website to allow users to retrace their steps easily, without the need 
                            to navigate manually. This enhancement will improve user-friendliness, especially for mobile users who may 
                            find it challenging to repeatedly use the smaller browser back button, particularly for elderly users who may 
                            have difficulty noticing it.
                        </p>
                        <p align="justify">The team will be working on these enhancements and simultaneously preparing for the exhibition

                        <p align="justify">The team was split into 2 groups today, one focusing on the website development and the other 
                            focusing on the poster design so that we are able to fully concentrate on each part and finish both as soon 
                            as possible. There were some issues faced today during the development where we realized certain scripts were 
                            not working within the website. We managed to fix majority of the issues except the media query for the phone 
                            view which we will be resolving as soon as possible. After which, we hosted the website through Github pages 
                            such that our website will be publicly available for viewing.
                        </p>
                        <p align="justify">As for the poster, the team went in for a consultation today regarding the current version of 
                            the poster as we felt that the poster was too wordy and was confused in which direction we should take. The 
                            main issue was its wordiness, which overwhelmed the key message we wanted to convey. To address this, we 
                            decided to streamline the content, focusing on the most critical information and removing unnecessary details 
                            that distracted from the core theme.

                            We narrowed it down to the background, problem statement, solution, and key features. Additionally, we made 
                            sure to include more images, increase the font size, and add QR codes to allow visitors to view the actual 
                            website, making the poster more engaging.
                        </p>
                        <p align="justify">Our goal for tomorrow will be to fix the media query on the mobile version of the website, 
                            conduct a final runthrough of the website to ensure that everything is working as intended, and finalize the 
                            poster design.

                        <p align="justify">Today is the last day before the exhibition tomorrow, our agenda for the day includes two 
                            crucial tasks: finalizing the website and conducting thorough testing and preparation for the exhibition.
                            We first started with finalizing the poster, making sure that the poster is concise, visually appealing, and 
                            can effectively convey the message we wanted to share with the exhibition attendees.
                        </p>
                        <p align="justify">Moving on, we did a final check on the website for its responsiveness across different devices, such as 
                            laptops, mobile phones and tablets. We also conducted thorough checks to identify and resolve any technical issues  
                            like broken links, missing images, or formatting errors. By conducting these tests rigorously, we aim to eliminate 
                            any potential hiccups that might hinder the success of the exhibition.
                        </p>
                        <p align="justify">With everything in place and our spirits high, we eagerly anticipate the exhibition day, 
                            excited to share our efforts with the clients and peers, as well as making a meaningful contribution to the 
                            event!

                        <p align="justify">Today was the long-waited exhibition. The team was thrilled to finally showcase our hard work 
                            to the public and share the results of our efforts. During the exhibition, the feedback from our client, Jane, 
                            was incredibly positive. She expressed her utmost satisfaction with the website, which brought a sense of 
                            accomplishment and pride to our team. Knowing that our work had met and exceeded her expectations was truly 
                            rewarding.
                        </p>
                        <p align="justify">In addition to the exhibition, we also made sure to promptly email Jane all the documents she 
                            had requested. This further strengthened our relationship with her and demonstrated our commitment to meeting 
                            her needs even after the project’s completion. Overall, we felt honoured and grateful for the opportunity to 
                            work on such a meaningful project and we look forward to the future developments of the website and further 
                            collaborations with Jane and other clients.
