                        <h2>19th July 2023</h2>
                        <p align="justify">The team, together with Team 5A, met with the client for the first time today. 
                            Leveraging the questions we prepared the previous day, we gained a deeper understanding of the client’s 
                            expectations and were able to align our development objectives. We were able to identify the key requirements
                            and goals that the client wants to achieve through the archival system:</p>

                            <ol>
                                <li>Create a straightforward design that highlights the events conducted and the rich history behind 
                                    various art pieces created by the community within The Annexe’s building</li>
                                <li>Allowing the system to act as bridge to connect with younger audiences</li>
                                <li>System should preferably be accessed through portable handheld devices, e.g. mobile
                                    phones or tablets</li>
                            </ol>

                        <p align="justify">The first requirement is catered to the current demographic at The Annexe, which mainly 
                            consists of elderly individuals aged 60 and above. Their lack of technological expertise requires 
                            our design to be extremely user-friendly to guide them through the application. The team came up with several
                            suggestions to improve usability, such as increasing the font size, incorporating more images to support
                            text descriptions, and introducing audio narrations to aid the elderly with poor eyesight.</p>

                        <p align="justify">Regarding the second requirement, the client mentioned that Annexe Communities provides help
                            to people aged 18 and above, however, the majority of the members are older people. She wishes that the system is able
                            to attract individuals of all age groups, especially from the younger demographic so that they can foster
                            a sense of unity and reinforce the community bond. The team thought of creating an Instagram account as it is 
                            one of the more popular social platforms used by the younger generation. However, we had our doubts on whether
                            this approach is feasible as it seem to be out of the project's scope. Additional work will have to be done 
                            by the Annexe staff to run the Instagram account frequently. Hence, we will be finding an alternative 
                            approach instead.</p>

                        <p align="justify">For the third requirement, the client's expectation was to have the members or visitors carry a 
                            handheld device during walks in the Annexe building and the device will provide information about the particular 
                            spot in the building. The team initially thought of creating a mobile app that can be used on phones 
                            and tablets. However, due to time constraints, creating a mobile application might not be a
                            feasible plan as it requires more time to develop as compared to a web application. Hence, the team 
                            decided to work on a mobile-friendly web application that is suitable for both laptops and mobile devices.</p>

                        <p align="justify">After receiving valuable information from our client, the team started working on the 
                            low-fidelity prototypes using paper sketches to map out the designs of our web application. Our immediate task
                            for tomorrow will be to focus on structuring the layout for the web application based on the low-fidelity prototype 
                            and identify any potential challenges so that we can address them promptly.</p>

                        <p align="justify">Today, the team made further progress in refining the low-fidelity prototype of the web 
                            application. After confirming the initial prototype yesterday, we shared a screenshot with the client, 
                            who responded positively to it. Subsequently, the team began the development phase using HTML and CSS.
                            The team finalized the main pages of the web application, which include the: </p>

                                <li>Homepage</li>
                                <li>About Us</li>
                                <li>History</li>
                                <li>Art</li>
                                <li>Events</li>
                                <li>Forum</li>

                            </ol>
                            
                        <p align="justify">Additionally, the color scheme was determined, with the main colors being purple, black, 
                            and white. The base layout of the homepage has been completed, with some minor improvements scheduled for 
                            later. Moreover, buttons to navigate the About Us, History, Art, Event, Forum, and Classes pages have been 
                            created. One significant challenge encountered today was arranging the contents on the homepage. Given 
                            that it incorporates images, texts, and animations, the team exerted extra effort to categorize and 
                            arrange them meticulously to achieve a visually appealing webpage. Fortunately, the team managed to 
                            resolve the majority of the issue, with some minor bugs that will be addressed on the following day.</p>
